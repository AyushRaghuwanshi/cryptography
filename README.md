# cryptography
 **Rsa_implementation(folder)** = This folder contain server.py and client.py file.first we have to start server and then client to connect than we have to set value of parameter to make public and private key in client than we have to send this public to server which will be used by server to encrypt the data for further message passing . client will use its private key to decode the message.
 
 **DES** = DES.ipynb file contains implementaion of des(Data Encryption Standard), which is a symmetri-key algorithm(uses same key to decrypt and encrypt).
